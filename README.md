# TrafficSignRecognition
A convulational neural network built on German Traffic Sign Dataset to recognise International Traffic Signs on its own.
 I have tried some pretrained models like ResNet9 and LeNet. Got best result with this Convolutional Architecture with 4 Convultional Layers 
 along with MaxPool Layers and Final Dense Layers. I was able to post an accuracy of 99.71% on training along with 97.19% accuracy on the test dataset.
